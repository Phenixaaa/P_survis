        "abstract": "This paper presents the first results of an agent-based model aimed at designing feeder bus routes able to cover the gap between public transport coverage and ridership in weak demand areas. The optimized design of feeder bus routes has been approached as a Vehicle Routing Problem applied to passenger transport, using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to find the minimum cost paths within a road network. The methodology proposed has been applied to the case of Catania (Italy), where a metro line is being extended to the city centre to peripheral areas. A GIS approach has been used to build the road network, select all potential bus stops, and weight them via accessibility indicators, as a proxy of the potential transport demand. Then, the ACO algorithm has been developed and implemented in NetLogo, a multi-agent programming and modelling environment for simulating complex systems, in order to find an optimal set of feeder bus routes, where the terminal is a given metro station. These routes are chosen to maximize the potential demand of passengers while complying with the constraint of a desired travel time. Different scenarios have been analysed by comparing a set of key performance indicators based on service coverage and ridership. First results highlight the validity of the method to find suitable routes to cover the gap between conventional public transport and weak demand urban areas and provide useful suggestions for the operation and design of a feeder service.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic path optimization is an important part of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). Aiming at the shortcomings of the current dynamic path optimization method, the improved ant colony algorithm was used to optimize the dynamic path. Through the actual investigation and analysis, the influencing factors of the multiobjective planning model were determined. The ant colony algorithm was improved by using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to transform path length, travel time, and traffic flow into the comprehensive weight-influencing factor. Meanwhile, directional guidance and dynamic optimization were introduced to the improved ant colony algorithm. In the simulated road network, the length of the optimal path obtained by the improved ant colony algorithm in the simulation road network is 3.015, which is longer than the length of the optimal path obtained by the basic ant colony algorithm (2.902). The travel time of the optimal path obtained by the improved ant colony algorithm (376\u2009s) is significantly shorter than that of the basic ant colony algorithm (416.3\u2009s). The number of iterations of the improved ant colony algorithm (45) is less than that of the basic ant colony algorithm (58). In the instance network, the number of iterations of the improved ant colony algorithm (18) is less than that of the basic ant colony algorithm (26). The travel time of the optimal path obtained by the improved ant colony algorithm (377.1\u2009s) is significantly shorter than that of the basic ant colony algorithm (426\u2009s) and the spatial shortest distance algorithm (424\u2009s). Compared with the basic ant colony algorithm and the spatial shortest distance algorithm, the results of the optimal path obtained by the improved ant colony algorithm were more accurate, and the effectiveness of the improved ant colony algorithm was verified.",

        "abstract": "Bus-based Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is an excellent solution to cope with the highly dynamic and inconsistent structure of conventional vehicular network. In this paper, an algorithm for Internet of Energy in the context of Bus-based VANET is proposed, i.e., street-centric routing scheme (SCRS) to address the problem of optimal-route and relay-bus selection. Firstly, we propose a multipath routing scheme using probability of street consistency and probability of path consistency. The multipath improves performance concerning packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay. Secondly, to enhance the packet forwarding, a new relay-bus selection mechanism is introduced by ant colony optimization (ACO)-based clustering. The relay-bus aims to transmit packets to next forwarding relay. Results show that clustering in ACO algorithm improves the relay-bus selection process by decreasing the computational cost, end-to-end delay, and unnecessary beacon messages. Thus, we conclude that the employment of multipath and clustering significantly improves performance of SCRS.",

        "abstract": "Nuclear power plant emergency can cause serious damage in a short time, in order to improve the evacuate efficiency of the nuclear power plant planning restricted area. An emergency evacuation organization strategy of nuclear power plant planning restricted area is established. Which is implemented by establishing an multi-objective integrated optimization model based on bus evacuation for nuclear power plant emergency. Firstly, based on the theory of minimum cost flow, a three-layer objective optimization model was established with the shortest total travel time of all evacuation buses as the primary objective, the shortest total evacuation distance of all evacuation buses as the secondary objective, the reliability of travel time as the third objective, and the constraint conditions of flow conservation, setting reversible lanes and eliminating intersection conflict points. Secondly, the route selection model based on adaptive ant colony algorithm is improved, and the travel time is combined with road saturation and attraction factor can prevent congestion drift phenomenon and improve the prediction accuracy of road network state. The optimal solution set of the model is obtained by using the improved algorithm through case verification. Finally, the strategy is validated by obtaining a bus evacuation organization scheme for a coastal nuclear power plant in China. The results show that through the application of the strategy, the LRP\uff08location routing problems\uff09 solution are obtained, and the feasibility of the model and algorithm is verified",

        "abstract": "Adding new lines on the basis of the existing public transport network is an important way to improve public transport operation networks and the quality of urban public transport service. Aiming at the problem that existing routes are rarely considered in the previous research on public transportation network planning, a public transportation network optimization method based on an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm coupled with the existing routes is proposed. First, the actual road network and existing bus lines were abstracted with a graph data structure, and the integration with origin\u2013destination passenger flow data was completed. Second, according to the ACO algorithm, combined with the existing line structure constraints and ant transfer rules at adjacent nodes, new bus-line planning was realized. Finally, according to the change of direct passenger flow in the entire network, the optimal bus-line network optimization scheme was determined. In the process of node transfer calculation, the algorithm adopts the Softmax strategy to realize path diversity and increase the path search range, while avoiding premature convergence and falling into local optimization. Moreover, the elite ant strategy increases the pheromone release on the current optimal path and accelerates the convergence of the algorithm. Based on existing road network and bus lines, the algorithm carries out new line planning, which increases the rationality and practical feasibility of the new bus-line structure.",
